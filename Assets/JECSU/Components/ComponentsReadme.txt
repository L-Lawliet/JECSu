Here lie "native" or "default" components that are maintained by the entity system.
    How to:
        to create new component just copy paste other one or manually create using other as template.
        after you've done this don't forget to go to unity top menu and > EntitySystem > Compile 
        so that all components will get compiled to ComponentFactory class, its NOT NECESSARY
        (the system will work fine without it) , but it speeds up component creation a bit.
